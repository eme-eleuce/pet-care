Ever since I was a little girl, I have had a passion for animals, and I always knew that my life&apos;s path would involve them. After years of working in various animal-related fields, I decided to start my own pet sitting company to offer high-quality pet care services to the local community. </p>
      <p className='mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify'>With over 5 years of experience in pet care, I have learned that every animal is unique and requires personalized attention. That&apos;s why I make sure to get to know each pet and their personality to provide them with the best possible care.</p>
